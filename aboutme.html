<p>  Umm I wonder what I should put on my 1st website, lets me give a little about myself, my name is Maram, I’m 28 years old. 
I work as an administrative assistant in National Guard Health Affair. I have a bachelor degree in law and a Master degree in business administration.
The reason I took this course I have a passion for machine and computers since I was little but didn’t get the chance to have an IT degree in college, 
I took this chance to dive in the web development world.  I love this course already and I’m really excited for what's to come.i would like to dedicate my 1st site  to the thing I LOVE TO DO, 
which is JIGSAW PUZZLE. </p>
